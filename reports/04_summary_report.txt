BEST MODEL: Gradient Boosting (Tuned)
====================================
  Test AUROC: 0.9846
  Optimal Threshold: 0.0197

Performance Metrics:
  - Sensitivity (Recall): 0.9491
  - Specificity: 0.9366
  - Positive Predictive Value (Precision): 0.2484
  - Negative Predictive Value: 0.9988
  - Accuracy: 0.9368
  - F1 Score: 0.3938

Confusion Matrix:
  - True Negatives: 99,971
  - False Positives: 6,771
  - False Negatives: 120
  - True Positives: 2,238

Interpretation:
  - The model correctly identifies 94.9% of patients who will die
  - The model correctly identifies 93.7% of patients who will survive
  - When model predicts death, it's correct 24.8% of the time
  - When model predicts survival, it's correct 99.9% of the time

Clinical Implications:
  - High AUROC (>0.98) indicates excellent discriminative ability
  - Model can be used to stratify patients by mortality risk
  - Could enable early intervention for high-risk patients
  - Supports value-based care by optimizing resource allocation

Next Steps:
  - Validate on external datasets
  - Develop clinical decision support tool
  - Create patient-facing risk calculator
  - Proceed to model interpretation and deployment planning
